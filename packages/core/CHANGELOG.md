# @arethetypeswrong/core

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 8b098c0: Changed `checkPackage` signature to accept a package FS as created by new `createPackageFromNpm`, `createPackageFromTarballUrl`, or `createPackageFromTarballData` functions. `createPackageFromNpm` resolves version ranges.

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- 27ad5a7: Expose parsePackageSpec in @arethetypeswrong/core/utils

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 7c3a377: If a packages has no `exports` field, look for additional entry points marked by extra `package.json` files with a `"main"` field in subdirectories.
- 53e031b: Inlined `InternalResolutionErrorDetails` into `InternalResolutionError` and renamed the interface to `InternalResolutionErrorProblem` to match other problem interfaces

### Patch Changes

- 53e031b: Fixed an issue where InternalResolutionError and UnexpectedModuleSyntax could be duplicated
- 53e031b: Fixed an issue where InternalResolutionError was missing traces

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 6fc935a: Added links to new documentation for each problem kind

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- d107355:
  - New problem kind: **Internal resolution error** indicates that an import in one of the packageâ€™s type declaration files failed to resolve. Either this indicates that runtime resolution errors will occur, or (more likely) the types misrepresent the contents of the JavaScript files.
  - Significant API changes. Most significantly, problems are returned as part of `checkPackage`, and `summarizeProblems`/`getSummarizedProblems` have been replaced by a collection of utilities for grouping and filtering problems.

## 0.0.6

- Fixed an error processing some packages due to different tarball metadata

## 0.0.5

- API additions: added `packageVersion` property to `TypedAnalysis` and `UntypedAnalysis` and added `packageName` to `UntypedAnalysis`

## 0.0.4

- New problem kind: **Syntax is incompatible with detected module kind.**

## 0.0.3

- Fixed a bug where 0-byte files in tarballs were interpreted as non-existent.

## 0.0.2

- New problem kind: **Resolved through a fallback condition.**
- Fixed a bug where the ESM/CJS module kind could be inaccurate for `.d.cts`, `.d.mts`, and `.json` files.

## 0.0.1

- Added CHANGELOG
- New problem kind: **CJS module uses a default export.**
- New problem kind: **Types incorrectly use a default export.**
